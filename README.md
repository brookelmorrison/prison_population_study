# Prison Population Study
Studying prison population in Illinois to examine the affect of COVID policies on counties and other groups

I was asked to analyze the population of prisons in Illinois to determine if the policies of the Governor of Illinois regarding accepting inmates into Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) facilities during COVID were causing any disparate impact. This repository holds publicly available data from the Illinois Department of Corrections, a summary file with more background information, and a Jupyter Notebook file with the analysis code in Python.

I had to manually clean some files as county names were not all the same, so some data files have two versions, an original and a corrected version. I combined the quarterly files and wrote four functions that I used to analyze different aspects of the data.

While some trends are interesting, I could not identify any disparate impact that could by used by counties to push for IDOC accepting more newly incarcerated individuals from the counties. In fact, it seems that the administration was very careful to ensure that no disadvantaged parties were harmed in their administration of their policies.

However, there were some trends as to population changes to different facilities that were interesting. It appears that the administration may be targeting certain facilities for closure as several were harder hit by population changes than others. These will be explored more thoroughly in Tableau at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brooke7903.

Please see the Summary and Summary Data files for more information about the project and the analysis file.
